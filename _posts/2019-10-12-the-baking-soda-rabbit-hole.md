title: "The Baking Soda Rabbit Hole"
date: 2019-10-12
---

*Before properly beginning this post, I feel an introductory paragraph might be necessary as this is the first ever post on this blog.*

*Today, while looking up baking soda, I happened upon a lot of interesting information that I jotted down into a notebook, but was also inspired to start documenting some of this knowledge in a (at least slightly more permanent) way to both share my passion with cooking and also for myself to look back on in the future. Thus, this blog was born, with the totally uncreative name of Potashium, a combination of Potash and Potassium.*

*The majority of this blog will be an unstructured, largely unedited stream of consciousness. The reason for this are two-fold.*

1. *The more effort this blog takes, the less likely I will be to continue this*
2. *I think the purpose of a blog includes maintaining a personal voice, an authenticity, that's difficult to preserve when things are too polished.*

*Now, for the actual blog post.*

## Motivating Questions

Today I went down a rabbit hole for the history, properties, and use cases for baking soda which I'd like to share in this blog post.

There are a few motivating questions that got me curious on the topic to begin with.

1. What is the difference between baking soda and baking powder?
2. Why do people use vinegar and baking soda to neutralize odors in the house?

From these two questions, of course more sprang up along the way, which I will attempt to recreate as closely as possible to my original rabbit-hole quest. They went roughly as follows:

3. How is baking soda processed?
4. How was baking soda first discovered?
5. How is baking soda/baking powder different from yeast?
6. How are pancakes fluffed?
7. What is gluten, and why is it important for fluffy pancakes?
8. What does baking soda have to do with the Maillard reaction?
9. The ultimate question -- what's the optimal ratio of alkaline to acid for fluffy pancakes? 

The last question, #7, will hopefully be the first of many experiments I will be conducting in my kitchen in the future. Before that happens, I will be sure to draft up an experimental procedure, and a database for logging my observations as I play around with different variables.

## Answers

**1. What is the difference between baking soda and baking powder?**

Baking soda is actually a core component of baking powder. Baking powder is composed of baking soda, an alkaline (basic, so above 7.0 on the pH scale), and a weak acid (usually cream of tartar in modern commercial production). The two are prevented from reacting when combined together by introducing a buffer such as corn starch (the reaction is sparked by water, so the corn starch acts as a dessicant of any excess moisture).

Other weak acids commonly used for recipes include buttermilk, lemon juice, and vinegar, as well as the lesser-known acids honey and chocolate! (Pure cocoa powder is ~5.5 pH). 

- Lemon (2.0)
- Vinegar (2.4)
- Honey (4.0)
- Buttermilk (4.6)
- Cream of tartar (5.0)
- Cocoa (5.5)
- Meat! (5.5)
- Milke (6.6)

Buttermilk was a common ingredient in the Southern U.S. a few centuries ago. I used to think buttermilk was milk mixed with butter, but I realize what a silly assumption that is considering (1) butter is made from milk and (2) that would just be half-and-half milk. Instead, buttermilk is the leftover byproduct after churning butter. It's a fermented watery substance, traditionally nonfat, and comparable to yogurt in that it is acidic from containing numerous cultures. 

Microbial cultures are basically live bacteria, yeasts, or mould that assist in the fermentation of various foods. As the bacteria eat the sugars in milk, they produce lactic acid, which gives products like yogurt and buttermilk a tart and tangy flavor. It also serves as a food safety measure, as most harmful bacteria can't survive around lactic acid. <<Later, will add more about the process of the creation of yogurt/cheese>>

Rather than buttermilk, modern day baking powder recipes actually use cream of tartar, which historically was the least common acid because it comes from wine production, which was very expensive to be shipping over from the wine-loving Europe to America in the 19th century. Indeed, cream of tartar is scraped off the side of barrels after the fermentation of wine.

Instead, the inventor of baking powder, a researcher at the lab in Harvard University boiled down the marrow of the bones of animals. After the creation of this, people no longer had to buy separate baking soda and an acid, and the baking powder production industry boomed into modern-day corporate America. I'll dig deeper into this during question #4.

**2. Why do people use vinegar and baking soda for household cleaning?**

As mentioned previously, baking soda is a basic alkali that produces water, salt, and carbon dioxide gas when mixed with an acid. The sources of many common household odors are acidic (the tart, pungent smell is usually the result of acidity). Therefore, mixing these smells with baking soda tends to neutralize these odors.

Likewise, odors whose sources are basic are neutralized when mixed with vinegar. Any last remaining smells can be washed away physically by hot water.

**3. How is baking soda processed?**

There are two main sources (or, rather, processing traditions) for baking soda. First, is the method prevalent in the majority of the world: the **Solvay Process**, which uses limestone. Second, is the process used in the U.S., which uses trona ore.

In the Solvay Process, carbon dioxide (CO2) is produced from limestone (CaCO3), which then reacts with ammonia (NH3) dissolved in brine water (NaCl). The result is sodium carbonate (NaHCO3).

In the U.S., trona ore is mined directly from the ground either through carving out the mineral or by using hot water underground to dissolve the minerals. The resulting rocks are crushed into a powder and passed through multiple stages of water filtration to remove impurities. The slurry is then placed into a centrifuge to dehydrate the remaining crystals, which are then dried and send to strage bins for transport.

**4. How was baking soda discovered?**

Baking soda has been around since the Ancient Egyptians, who used sodium carbonate as a soap-like cleaning agent. They also used to it to make mummies. 1846 was when The Arm & Hammer brand was created. Their logo represents Vulcan, the roman god of fire and metalworking.

**5. How is baking soda/powder different from yeast?**

I think I will probably dedicate an entire separate post to the properties of yeast, but will do my best to summarize what I know here. As explained previously, baking soda creates carbon dioxide gas when mixed with an acid through a simple chemical reaction of trading Hydrogen ions (H+) with hydroxide ions (OH-).

By contrast, yeast is a live organism that eats sugars present in dough, and releases CO2 as a byproduct. <<I will link a more detailed blog post on yeast here when it is completed>>

**6. How are pancakes fluffed?**

The star of the show, **pancakes**, are typically fluffed by baking powder, or a combination of baking powder/soda and buttermilk. Thus, there are two main phases of when the batter rises: immediately after the baking powder is activated by liquid, which is when the base/acid reaction occurs to produce CO2. You should do your best not to let the batter sit too long after this phase, or all the first round bubbles will be gone. The second phase occurs in the pan itself, as many modern brands of baking powder include **sodium aluminum sulfate**, a compound that breaks down into an acid when heated and further reacts with baking soda to release gas. However, you should not rely on the second round of bubbles to suffice, as the majority of the CO2 is produced during the first round. These two rounds of bubbling make what is called a "Double acting" baking powder (single acting baking powders are typically only available for commercial use).

However, overmixing the batter will cause too much gluten to form (see section on gluten below), so it is imperative not to mix too much or the pancakes will end up rubbery and tough.

<<I will do in-depth posts about different types of pastries: bread, cake, pancakes, cookies, biscuits, crackers>>

<<I will write a post in the future about the different types of flour>>

**7. What is gluten, and why is it important for fluffy pancakes?**

Flour contains two types of protein: glutenin and gliadin. When moistened with water, the proteins link into a malleable molecular mesh called gluten. Furthermore, gluten can increase indefinitely in length to form sticky and stretchy webs, which is what gives dough its net-like property. This is also what allows for different types of pastries to trap air by way of leavening agents.

**8. What does baking soda have to do with the Maillard reaction?**

The Maillard reaction is what is responsible for the "browning" of different types of foods on their surfaces, and what we typically equate with the savory and delicious smells wafting out of our grandmother's kitchen.

Specifically, the reaction refers to when amino acids within the food bond with carbon and oxygen atoms present in sugars. These sugars include glucose, fructose, and ribose. The result are unique mixes of molecules called flavor polymers, of which scientists have already discovered 1000+. Examples include:

- Diacetyl (butter)
- Furan (nutty)
- Acetaldehyde (rum)

Maillard --> caramelization (sugars darkening) --> pyrolisis (burning)

Actually, the Maillard reaction also occurs in processes such as in the production of cheese, the curing of meat, the production of soy sauce, and even in rotting. However, in this case, rather than the use of heat to spur the reaction, enzymes instead break down sugars and proteins. The enzymatic process occurs at <70 degrees C, while the process for heat occurs above 140 degrees C. **An important point to note here is that in order to optimize the Maillard reaction when searing meat, you should dessicate the meat while marinating by adding salt and/or baking soda**

This relates back to baking soda because alkali environments are the most conducive to the Maillard reaction, so adding more baking soda to pancakes will cause them to brown more. This is because alkali "loosen" protons in the amino acids/reducing sugars (by contrast, amino acids will hold onto their protons in the presence of acids). However, adding too much baking soda causes too violent of a reaction with the acids, which results in the CO2 bubbles forming to rapidly and the pancake will "pop". 


**9. The ultimate question -- what's the optimal ratio of alkaline to acid for fluffy pancakes?**

## Other fun facts/notes

1. Bases are bitter if not neutralized by an acid, so you don't want to use too much baking soda in your recipes
2. When baking soda is mixed with an acid, the precursor to CO2 gas is carbonic acid, which is a slightly acidic liquid that's used in carbonated beverages
3. You can use baking soda to tenderize meats! (see note on how alkali help loosen the protons in amino acids/sugars). 1/2 teaspoon for 500g of meat for 20-30 minutes
