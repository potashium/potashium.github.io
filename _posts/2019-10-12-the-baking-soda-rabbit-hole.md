title: "The Baking Soda Rabbit Hole"

*Before properly beginning this post, I feel an introductory paragraph might be necessary as this is the first ever post on this blog.*

*Today, while looking up baking soda, I happened upon a lot of interesting information that I jotted down into a notebook, but was also inspired to start documenting some of this knowledge in a (at least slightly more permanent) way to both share my passion with cooking and also for myself to look back on in the future. Thus, this blog was born, with the totally uncreative name of Potashium, a combination of Potash and Potassium.*

*The majority of this blog will be an unstructured, largely unedited stream of consciousness. The reason for this are two-fold.*

1. *The more effort this blog takes, the less likely I will be to continue this*
2. *I think the purpose of a blog includes maintaining a personal voice, an authenticity, that's difficult to preserve when things are too polished.*

*Now, for the actual blog post.*

Today I went down a rabbit hole for the history, properties, and use cases for baking soda which I'd like to share in this blog post.

There are a few motivating questions that got me curious on the topic to begin with.

1. What is the difference between baking soda and baking powder?
2. Why do people use vinegar and baking soda to neutralize odors in the house?

From these two questions, of course more sprang up along the way, which I will attempt to recreate as closely as possible to my original rabbit-hole quest. They went roughly as follows:

3. How is baking soda processed?
4. How was baking soda first discovered?
5. How is baking soda/baking powder different from yeast?
6. How are different pastries fluffed?
7. The ultimate question -- what's the optimal ratio of alkaline to acid for fluffy pancakes? 

The last question, #7, will hopefully be the first of many experiments I will be conducting in my kitchen in the future. Before that happens, I will be sure to draft up an experimental procedure, and a database for logging my observations as I play around with different variables.

Now, to the questions.

**1. What is the difference between baking soda and baking powder?**

Baking soda is actually a core component of baking powder. Baking powder is composed of baking soda, an alkaline (basic, so above 7.0 on the pH scale), and a weak acid (usually cream of tartar in modern commercial production). The two are prevented from reacting when combined together by introducing a buffer such as corn starch (the reaction is sparked by water, so the corn starch acts as a dessicant of any excess moisture).

Other weak acids commonly used for recipes include buttermilk, lemon juice, and vinegar, as well as the lesser-known acids honey and chocolate! (Pure cocoa powder is ~5.5 pH). 

Buttermilk was a common ingredient in the Southern U.S. a few centuries ago. I used to think buttermilk was milk mixed with butter, but I realize what a silly assumption that is considering (1) butter is made from milk and (2) that would just be half-and-half milk. Instead, buttermilk is the leftover byproduct after churning butter. It's a fermented watery substance, traditionally nonfat, and comparable to yogurt in that it is acidic from containing numerous cultures. 

Microbial cultures are basically live bacteria, yeasts, or mould that assist in the fermentation of various foods. As the bacteria eat the sugars in milk, they produce lactic acid, which gives products like yogurt and buttermilk a tart and tangy flavor. It also serves as a food safety measure, as most harmful bacteria can't survive around lactic acid. **Later, will add more about the process of the creation of yogurt/cheese**

Rather than buttermilk, modern day baking powder recipes actually use cream of tartar, which historically was the least common acid because it comes from wine production, which was very expensive to be shipping over from the wine-loving Europe to America in the 19th century. Indeed, cream of tartar is scraped off the side of barrels after the fermentation of wine.

Instead, the inventor of baking powder, a researcher at the lab in Harvard University boiled down the marrow of the bones of animals. After the creation of this, people no longer had to buy separate baking soda and an acid, and the baking powder production industry boomed into modern-day corporate America.
