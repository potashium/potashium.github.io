title: "The Baking Soda Rabbit Hole"

*Before properly beginning this post, I feel an introductory paragraph might be necessary as this is the first ever post on this blog.*

*Today, while looking up baking soda, I happened upon a lot of interesting information that I jotted down into a notebook, but was also inspired to start documenting some of this knowledge in a (at least slightly more permanent) way to both share my passion with cooking and also for myself to look back on in the future. Thus, this blog was born, with the totally uncreative name of Potashium, a combination of Potash and Potassium.*

*The majority of this blog will be an unstructured, largely unedited stream of consciousness. The reason for this are two-fold.*

1. *The more effort this blog takes, the less likely I will be to continue this*
2. *I think the purpose of a blog includes maintaining a personal voice, an authenticity, that's difficult to preserve when things are too polished.*

*Now, for the actual blog post.*

Today I went down a rabbit hole for the history, properties, and use cases for baking soda which I'd like to share in this blog post.

There are a few motivating questions that got me curious on the topic to begin with.

1. What is the difference between baking soda and baking powder?
2. Why do people use vinegar and baking soda to neutralize odors in the house?

From these two questions, of course more sprang up along the way, which I will attempt to recreate as closely as possible to my original rabbit-hole quest. They went roughly as follows:

3. How is baking soda processed?
4. How was baking soda first discovered?
5. How is baking soda/baking powder different from yeast?
6. How are different pastries fluffed?
7. The ultimate question -- what's the optimal ratio of alkaline to acid for fluffy pancakes? 

The last question, #7, will hopefully be the first of many experiments I will be conducting in my kitchen in the future. Before that happens, I will be sure to draft up an experimental procedure, and a database for logging my observations as I play around with different variables.

Now, to the questions.
