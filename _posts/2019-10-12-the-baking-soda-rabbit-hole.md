title: "The Baking Soda Rabbit Hole"

Today I went down a rabbit hole for the history, properties, and use cases for baking soda. 

Before properly beginning this post, I feel an introductory paragraph might be necessary as this is the first ever post on this blog.

Today, while looking up baking soda, I happened upon a lot of interesting information that I jotted down into a notebook, but was also inspired to start documenting some of this knowledge in a (at least slightly more permanent) way to both share my passion with cooking and also for myself to look back on in the future. Thus, this blog was born, with the totally uncreative name of Potashium, a combination of Potash and Potassium.
