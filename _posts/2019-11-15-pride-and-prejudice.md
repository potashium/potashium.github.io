*I am starting a new hobby of reading books, borne out of a realization that my day-to-day life is exceedingly boring. I think every remote worker reaches a time in their life when they've watched every Youtube video, smirked at every Reddit meme. At such a time, I've started becoming bored out of my mind, and being the stingy and lazy person I am, I sought a hobby that didn't require money or leaving the house. And so, reading was chosen.*

*I'm starting by selecting books from Project Gutenberg's top 100 most popular online books. The first book I chose is a book I read during my time in college as part of a required class. I remember really enjoying the book, as it is a very quick, light, and entertaining read. Honestly, in my opinion, it's the first ever soap opera. It appeals to heavily to women (sorry, I know, I am very sexist) in ways I'll enumerate later. Overall, however, it was a nice introduction to the hobby, and I hope I'll keep it going longer.*

*One thing I want to add as well is writing blog posts as a reflection piece after reading each book. I think it will be a good exercise for me to digest everything that I read. Also, it may help me improve/brush up on my writing ability, which has taken a serious hit as a result of leaving school. I realized it has become much more difficult for me to remember proper grammar, cadence, and flow than ever before, which is quite sad considering writing used to be one of my best talents in school.*

## Overall ideas

1. Mr. Darcy and Elizabeth as the quintessential soap opera main character and love interest
2. Reflections on modern-day romance
3. Why is it considered a classic?

## Details

**1. Mr. Darcy and Elizabeth as the quintessential soap opera main character and love interest**

Writing in 2019, I have seen and read more than my fair share of the following stock plot for romance pieces: a girl of mediocre background but slightly above-average looks, a disdain for "other girls"/a tomboyish streak, and above-average wit/intelligence meets a rich, devilishly handsome, cold, and haughty man. Something happens at the outset that makes them hate each other, but the man secretly takes an interest in the woman before gradually falling in love with her against his own wishes. The rest of the plot then centers around the two of them realizing their feelings for each other. 

This is exactly what happens in Pride and Prejudice. 

**2. Reflections on modern-day romance**

In my opinion, we have reached a point where the idea of a slightly masculine, intelligent, and sarcastic woman who is not afraid to speak her mind and stand up for herself is not quite as novel and eccentric as when Pride and Prejudice was first published. Jane is meant to embody the quintessential lady of the time period: kind-hearted, soft-spoken, polite, and level-headed. Without being too harsh on my own sex, I would say that in many parts of the Western world, the ideals have swapped. Many, many women are just like Elizabeth, and indeed, much of society encourages girls to adopt her character traits. On the flipside, there is the implied message to simultaneously reject traditionally feminine characteristics, such as a nurturing kindness, social tact, and patience with others' flaws.

Therefore, I think a modern day Pride and Prejudice would probably show opposite characters in Jane and Elizabeth. In this scenario, Mr. Darcy would have instead fell in love with Jane's affectionate and gentle temperament, humble intelligence and capability, and generally innocent and wholesome character.

**3. Why is it considered a classic?**

The main thing to consider when assessing Pride and Prejudice's place as a literary classic is its subject matter *with relation to* its time period. As I mentioned before, the plot is nothing new in 2019; in fact, it's hackneyed and overdone to the point of wanting to roll your eyes during a few moments throughout the book. However, published in the early 1800s, it was considered a novel type of plot at the time; furthermore, if it really were the first of its kind, one can understand why it instantly became so popular by looking at the popularity of rom-coms and TV soap operas in modern-day. Most women can relate to the main character, fall in love with a Mr. Darcy, and feel the same emotions as Elizabeth when placed in the awkward and infuriating social situations described in the book.

In addition to the plot, there are other literary techniques that Jane Austen is attributed to having first started. The first is the idea of a floating narrator, where the voice of the narrator changes to reflect a particular character. It is a way of adding dialogue and inner thought without actually entering first-person, and is done so artfully and subtly that it never feels abrupt or out-of-place.
