*I am starting a new hobby of reading books, borne out of a realization that my day-to-day life is exceedingly boring. I think every remote worker reaches a time in their life when they've watched every Youtube video, smirked at every Reddit meme. At such a time, I've started becoming bored out of my mind, and being the stingy and lazy person I am, I sought a hobby that didn't require money or leaving the house. And so, reading was chosen.*

*I'm starting by selecting books from Project Gutenberg's top 100 most popular online books. The first book I chose is a book I read during my time in college as part of a required class. I remember really enjoying the book, as it is a very quick, light, and entertaining read. Honestly, in my opinion, it's the first ever soap opera. It appeals to heavily to women (sorry, I know, I am very sexist) in ways I'll enumerate later. Overall, however, it was a nice introduction to the hobby, and I hope I'll keep it going longer.*

*One thing I want to add as well is writing blog posts as a reflection piece after reading each book. I think it will be a good exercise for me to digest everything that I read. Also, it may help me improve/brush up on my writing ability, which has taken a serious hit as a result of leaving school. I realized it has become much more difficult for me to remember proper grammar, cadence, and flow than ever before, which is quite sad considering writing used to be one of my best talents in school.*
