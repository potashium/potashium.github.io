title: "My Favorite Flour"
date: 2019-10-17

*Breads are one of my favorite foods, as I can imagine is the case for many people. Who doesn't love carbs? More specifically, who doesn't love that feeling of biting into a soft but slightly chewy, moist, slightly sweet piece of bread with that faint yeasty aroma enveloping your taste buds?*

*On slightly more serious note, another reason flour has a special place in my heart is due to a particularly fond memory I have with a close friend of mine. This friend is from a part of the world that has a very endearing accent when speaking English. One day we were planning to make a pie from scratch, including the crust. I asked him to look up the ingredients and dictate them outloud while I transcribed -- "Eggs, milk... fla". So I wrote down... eggs, milk, and fla.*

*As we got to the grocery store, we walked around and gradually picked up everything on our list except for the one thing. I thought maybe it was an obscure baking ingredient, and at this point, I was still trying to impress this friend with my culinary prowess. I surreptitiously but frantically darted my eyes around as we perused the aisles, scanning each item we passed for this elusive ingredient.*

*Finally and with sheepishness in my eyes, I realized I could stall no longer. I looked up with pursed lips andmuttered out, "So uh... what is 'fla'?" He looked at me blank-eyed for a second, before he shot a Jim-from-the-Office look over his shoulder and smirked back at me. With his best heavy imitation American accent, he enunciates, "flow-ERR". To this day he does not let me live this moment down.*

*Now, to the blog post!*

## Motivating Questions

As I was preparing the last post on baking soda, particularly in reading up on its uses for fluffiness, I frequently came across notes that an equally important factor is the type of flour one uses. Unsurprisingly, this led to a second trip down the rabbit hole, but this time on the various types and properties of flour. Motivating this blog post are the following questions:

1. What are the general types of flour you will find in a grocery store, and what are their primary differences?
2. What is the difference between hard and soft wheat?
3. What is the flour bleaching process?
4. What is the role of acidity in baking?
5. What is the history of flour?

<<Another day, I will do a post exploring the different types of grains>>

## Results

### 1. Types of flour

There are 10 broad types of flour you will find in the supermarket:

1. All-purpose flour (10-12%)
2. Bread flour (14-16%)
3. Cake flour (7%)
4. Pastry flour (9%)
5. Whole wheat flour
6. White whole wheat flour
7. Oat flour
8. Semolina
9. Rice flour
10. Corn flour (corn meal is the same, just ground less fine)

The main difference between these types of flour will be the type of wheat that's used: hard or soft. These types of wheat differ in their protein and starch content - hard flours typically have more protein, which generates more gluten, leading to tougher pastries (but the gluten also traps and holds air bubbles petter). I have listed the protein content in parentheses above.

To increase the amount of protein or gluten in a bag of flour, you can add a few tablespoons of vital wheat gluten.

To decrease the amount of protein, you can add a few tablespoons of corn starch.

### 2. Hard vs. soft wheat

The difference between flour and starch is that flour is typically made by grinding the entire kernel of wheat/corn/rice, and therefore contains all nutrients like protein, fiber, starch, nutrients, and vitamins and minerals as with usual whole corn. Meanwhile, starch is made by only grinding the starchy center called the endosperm.

### 3. Flour bleaching process

Unbleached flours are actually still bleached, just naturally by being allowed to sit instead of chemically through a bleaching process.

The flour bleaching process typically creates a more acidic flour (see the next section on the role of acidity in baking)

### 4. Acidity and baking

Acidity helps baked goods with a large amount of sugar and low amounts of gluten to rise instead of collapse.

### 5. History of flour
