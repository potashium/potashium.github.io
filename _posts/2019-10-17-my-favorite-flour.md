title: "My Favorite Flour"
date: 2019-10-17

*Breads are one of my favorite foods, as I can imagine is the case for many people. Who doesn't love carbs? More specifically, who doesn't love that feeling of biting into a soft but slightly chewy, moist, slightly sweet piece of bread with that faint yeasty aroma enveloping your taste buds?*

*On slightly more serious note, another reason flour has a special place in my heart is due to a particularly fond memory I have with a close friend of mine. This friend is from a part of the world that has a very endearing accent when speaking English. One day we were planning to make a pie from scratch, including the crust. I asked him to look up the ingredients and dictate them outloud while I transcribed -- "Eggs, milk... fla". So I wrote down... eggs, milk, and fla.*

*As we got to the grocery store, we walked around and gradually picked up everything on our list except for the one thing. I thought maybe it was an obscure baking ingredient, and at this point, I was still trying to impress this friend with my culinary prowess. I surreptitiously but frantically darted my eyes around as we perused the aisles, scanning each item we passed for this elusive ingredient.*

*Finally and with sheepishness in my eyes, I realized I could stall no longer. I looked up with pursed lips andmuttered out, "So uh... what is 'fla'?" He looked at me blank-eyed for a second, before he shot a Jim-from-the-Office look over his shoulder and smirked back at me. With his best heavy imitation American accent, he enunciates, "flow-ERR". To this day he does not let me live this moment down.*

*Now, to the blog post!*

## Motivating Questions

As I was preparing the last post on baking soda, particularly in reading up on its uses for fluffiness, I frequently came across notes that an equally important factor is the type of flour one uses. Unsurprisingly, this led to a second trip down the rabbit hole, but this time on the various types and properties of flour. Motivating this blog post are the following questions:

1. What are the general types of flour you will find in a grocery store, and what are their primary differences?
2. What is the difference between hard and soft wheat? Whole wheat vs. white? Red vs. white?
3. What is the flour bleaching process?
4. What is the role of acidity in baking?
5. What is the history of flour?

<<Another day, I will do a post exploring the different types of grains>>

## Results

### 1. Types of flour

There are 9 broad types of wheat flour you will find in the supermarket:

1. All-purpose flour (10-12%)
2. Bread flour (14-16%)
3. Cake flour (7%)
4. Pastry flour (9%)
5. 100% Whole wheat flour
6. White whole wheat flour
7. Gluten flour (most starch removed)
8. Self-rising flour (all-purpose with baking powder and salt)
9. Semolina (11-12%) -- made from dulum for pasta

Then, there are several non-wheat flours

1. Almond meal -- high protein, low carbs. Used to add moisture and a nutty taste, but can't replace regular flour
2. Amaranth -- ancient seed. High protein, including lysine. Thickener for sauces, gravies, and soups
3. Barley -- adds fiber. Good as a thickener
4. Buckwheat -- heart, grassy flavor and color. Good for pasta and pancakes
5. Corn flour (corn meal is the same, just ground less fine)
6. Flaxseed -- has omega-3s. Can be used as a fat or egg substitute
7. Oat flour -- can replace flour. Rich, nutty flavor and denser texture. If in foods that need to rise, must be combined with other flours
8. Peanut flour -- see almond meal
9. Potato flour -- in bread, it makes bread more moist by adding starch, which attracts and holds water. It can be used as a thickener for smooth creamy sauces, soups, gravies, and frozen desserts. In meat, it can retain moisture
10. Rice flour (brown) -- nutty flavor. Used like white flour, but gives a grittier texture in baked goods like cornbread and pound cale
11. Rice flour (white) -- used in pie crusts, cookies, and a thickener for sauces. Gives a tender feel
12. Rye flour -- heavy and dark, with low gluten. Produces heavy, dense bread (ex. pumpernickel)
13. Soy flour -- high protein. Used to thicken sauces, and can be used to substitute some wheat flour in quick breads and cookies. It reduces fat absorption in frying batter or dough
14. Spelt flour -- spelt is an ancient grain and cousin to wheat. Slightly more portein with a mellow, nutty flavor

The main difference between these types of flour will be the type of wheat that's used: hard or soft. These types of wheat differ in their protein and starch content - hard flours typically have more protein, which generates more gluten, leading to tougher pastries (but the gluten also traps and holds air bubbles petter). I have listed the protein content in parentheses above.

To increase the amount of protein or gluten in a bag of flour, you can add a few tablespoons of vital wheat gluten.

To decrease the amount of protein, you can add a few tablespoons of corn starch.

### 2. Hard vs. soft wheat, white vs. whole wheat

_White vs. whole wheat_: Wheat seed heads have three portions: the germ, the bran, and the endosperm. White flour includes just the endosperm (so it's basically like corn starch -- see below). The reason for this is that while whole wheat contains more nutrients, the bran tears strands of gluten, thus inhibiting gluten development. Furthermore, whole wheat is more absorbent than white flour, necessitating the use of more liquid, creating a stickier dough, which can be challening for novices.

Gluten is a general name for a variety of proteins found in different types of wheat. Some grains do contain protein, but not the proteins that create gluten (ex. oat).

The difference between corn flour and corn starch is that flour is typically made by grinding the entire kernel of wheat/corn/rice, and therefore contains all nutrients like protein, fiber, starch, nutrients, and vitamins and minerals as with usual whole corn. Meanwhile, starch is made by only grinding the starchy center called the endosperm.

_Hard vs. soft_: This is just a general name for the protein content of a type of wheat. It is more-or-less a off-hand category.

_Red vs. white vs. Durum_: There are six categories of wheat grown in the U.S., and they are generally labeled by their protein content (hard or soft) and color (red or white), as well as the season of harvest (spring or winter). 

- Hard Red Winter -- high protein. Used for yeast bread, tortillas, cereal, and Asian noodles
- Hard Red Spring -- high protein. Used for artisan bread, croissants, bagels, and pizza crusts
- Hard White - high protein but milder and sweeter flavor. Used for pan bread, tortillas, and Asian noodles
- Soft Red Winter -- lower protein. Cookies, crackers, pastries, and pretzels
- Soft White -- lower protein, which naturally white color. Used for Asian bakery products, cakes, and pastries. It is the "cashmere" of wheats
- Durum -- the hardest of all six wheats. With a rich amber color and high gluten content, it is primarily used for pasta, couscous, and some Mediterranean breads

### 3. Flour bleaching process

Unbleached flours are actually still bleached, just naturally by being allowed to sit instead of chemically through a bleaching process.

The flour bleaching process typically creates a more acidic flour (see the next section on the role of acidity in baking)

### 4. Acidity and baking

Acidity helps baked goods with a large amount of sugar and low amounts of gluten to rise instead of collapse.

### 5. History of flour
