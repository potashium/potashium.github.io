title: "My Favorite Flour"

*Breads are one of my favorite foods, as I can imagine is the case for many people. Who doesn't love carbs? More specifically, who doesn't love that feeling of biting into a soft but slightly chewy, moist, slightly sweet piece of bread with that faint yeasty air enveloping your taste buds?*

*In slightly more seriousness, another reason flour has a special place on my palate is a particularly fond memory I have with one of my loved ones. This particular loved one is from a part of the world that has a very endearing accent when speaking English that I find incredibly adorable, though he finds repulsive and unrefined. Anyway, one day we were going out to make a pie from scratch, including the crust. I asked him to look up the ingredients and dictate them outloud while I transcribed -- "Eggs, milk... fla". So I wrote down... eggs, milk, and fla.*

*As we got to the grocery store, we walked around and gradually picked up everything on our list except for the one thing I was a bit sheepish to not know. I thought maybe it was an obscure baking ingredient, and at this point, I was still trying to impress this loved one with my culinary prowess. I surreptitiously but frantically darted my eyes around as we perused the aisles, scanning every ingredient we passed for this elusive ingredient.*

*Finally and with horror in my eyes, I realized I could stall no longer. I looked up with shame in my pursed lips as I muttered out, "So uh... what is 'fla'?" He looks at me blank-eyed for a second, before he shoots a Jim from the Office look over his shoulder and smirks back at me. With his best heavy imitation American accent, he enunciates, "flow-ERR" and to this day he does not let me live this moment down.*
